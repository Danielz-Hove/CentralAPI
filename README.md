# CentralAPI

CentralAPI is a multi-tenant Laravel backend API that powers multiple applications with centralized authentication, data management, and third-party integrations. It ensures secure and efficient communication across apps while maintaining independent tenant data.

## Features

- **Multi-Tenancy Support**: Each tenant's data is isolated for security and performance.
- **Custom Token-Based Authentication**: Secure access using middleware requiring a token for the Customers API.
- **RESTful API Endpoints**: Provides well-structured and scalable API endpoints.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Manage user roles and permissions.
- **Scalability**: Optimized for handling multiple tenants efficiently.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Seamlessly connects with external services.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Tracks system activity and ensures security compliance.

## API Documentation

The API follows RESTful conventions and uses JSON for responses. 
For detailed API documentation, refer to the `/docs` endpoint (if implemented with Swagger or Laravel API Documentation packages).

## Usage

- **Authentication:**
  - The Customers API requires a valid token via custom middleware.

- **Customers API (Authenticated):**
  - Create Customer: `POST /api/customers`
  - List Customers: `GET /api/customers`
  - Update Customer: `PUT /api/customers/{id}`
  - Delete Customer: `DELETE /api/customers/{id}`

- **Users API:**
  - Create User: `POST /api/users`
  - List Users: `GET /api/users`
  - Update User: `PUT /api/users/{id}`
  - Delete User: `DELETE /api/users/{id}`

## Security & Best Practices

- Use **HTTPS** in production.
- Implement **rate limiting** to prevent abuse.
- Store sensitive information in **environment variables**.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
